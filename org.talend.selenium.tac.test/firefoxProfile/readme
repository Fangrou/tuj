Copy the mimeTypes.rdf and prefs.js to any a folder(c:\Talend\ff\profile),then start server by: 
java -jar selenium-server*.jar -firefoxProfileTemplate C:\Talend\ff\profile.

Now, this way to use the firefox profile is to avoid the popup when loading a file.
(you can copy your own profile mineTypes.rdf and prefs.js  after manually set your firefox)
